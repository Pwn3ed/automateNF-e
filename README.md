# Eletronic Invoice Launching System

## :bulb: About

An electronic invoice launching system for the company I work for, where an .xlsx file ensures data integrity and keeps the client list updated. It uses Pandas for data manipulation and Selenium for browser automation, with event waits to ensure smooth project flow. The system has been used monthly by the company since 2021.
